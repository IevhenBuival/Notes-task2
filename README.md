### Hi, this is Task-2 on react + tailwind

https://ievhenbuival.github.io/Notes-task2/

We have Notes table and statistics table for notes categories (with quantity of notes per category).

You may:
add note - blue button at the top,
edit note - first button in action column at the end of row,
set arhive/active status - second button in action column at the end of row,
remove note - last button in action column at the end row.

Also you may filter by notes status (active/archived/all) using 'Filter by' drop-down.

Thanks for watching.
